In this code:

download_file function is responsible for downloading a file from a given URL to a specified destination.

classify_and_move function categorizes the downloaded file based on its extension and moves it to the appropriate folder within the destination folder.

The file_processor function continuously scans the download folder, classifies and moves files, and can be run in the background as a separate thread.

The main program accepts URLs for downloading files and runs the background file processing thread.

Make sure to specify the appropriate download folder and destination folder in the code. This code serves as a basic example, and you can enhance it further as needed.
